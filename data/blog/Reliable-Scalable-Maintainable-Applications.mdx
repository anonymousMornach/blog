- Many applications today are data-intensive rather than compute-intensive.
- **Raw CPU power** is rarely a limiting factor for these applications.

- The main issues are usually:

  - Data Amount

  - Data Complexity

  - The speed at which data changes.

_Data intensive applications are typically built from standard building blocks which provide a common needed functionality_. Example, many applications needs to:

- **Store data**, so it can be found when needed ([Databases](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/))
- **Remember results** of expensive operation, to speed up reads ([Caches](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/))
- Allow users to **search and filter** data by keyword and various ways ([Search Indexes](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/))
- **Send messages** to other process for asynchronous handling (**[Stream Processing](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)**)
- **Periodically crunch** a large amount of accumulated data (**[Batch Processing](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)**)

These data systems are such a succesful abstraction we use them without thinking too much.

When building an application, you wouldn't dream of writing a new data storage engine from scratch, because databases are a perfectly good tool for the job.

In the real world, things aren't that simple. We have so many database applications with different characteristics.

Different applications have different requirements

- There are various approaches to caching
- Several ways of buiding search indexes
- And many more.

So when building an application, we need to figure out the right tool and approach for the task at hand.

At times it is hard to combine several tools when you need to do something a single tool can't do alone.

### <u>**Thinking About Data Systems**</u>

> We typically think of **[Databases](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)**, **[Queues](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)** and **[Caches](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)** e.t.c as being different categories of tools.

Databases and Message queues have certain superficial similariies;

- They both store data for some time

**BUT** they have different access patterns, which leads to different performance characteristics and different implementations.

**SO** why are they under an umbrella term like _data systems_?

In recent years many new tools for data storage have emerged.

These tools are optimized for a variety of different use cases, and they no longer neatly fit into traditional categories. For Example;

- There are data stores that are also used as message queues such as **[Redis](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)**
- There are message queues with database-like durability guarantees **[Kafka](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)**

The boundaries between these categories are getting blurred.

Many applications now have such demanding or wide ranging requirements that a single tool can no longer meet all of its data processing and storage needs.

The work is broken down into tasks that can be performed efficiently on a single tool, and those different tools are stiched together using application code.

**FOR EXAMPLE**

- If you have an **application-managed caching layer** (using **[Memcached](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)** or similar), or a full-text search server separate from your main database (such as **[Elastisearch](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)** or **[Solr](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)**).
- It is normally the application code's responsibilty to keep those caches and indexes in sync with the main database.
- When you combine Several tools to provide a service, the service interface or API usually hides those implementation details from clients.
- You've essentially created a new special-purpose data system from smaller, general-purpose components.
- Your composite data system may provide certain guarantees, e.g that the cache will be correctly invalidated or updated on writes, so that outside clients see consistent results.
- You are now not only an application developer, but also a data system designer.

**When designing a data system or service, tricky questions that arise include**

- How do you ensure that the data remains correct and complete even when things go wrong internally?
- How do you provide consistently good perfomance to clients, even when parts of the system are degraded?
- How do you scale to handle an increase in load?
- What does a good API for the service look like?

**There are many factors that influence data system design, which includes**

- Skills and experience of the people involved.
- Legacy system dependencies
- Time scale for delivery
- Organization tolerance for different kinds of risks
- Regulatory constraints
- E.T.C

**There are three concerns that are most important in most software systems:**

- Reliability
  The system should continue to function correctly at the desired performance, even in the face for adversity, which may be hardware, software or even human error.
- Scalability
  As the system grows in data volume, traffic or complexity there should be reasonable ways of dealing with that growth.
- Maintainability
  Over time many different people will work on the system, they should be able to work on it productively.

We all use these terms without a clear Understandiing of what they mean.
